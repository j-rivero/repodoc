# Repodoc ChangeLog
#
# [NEW] - New feature
# [MOD] - Modified feature
# [FIX] - Fixed a bug

* 0.1_beta2 ( 2006-17-06 )

	- [NEW] Dyn-meta module. Checks whether dynamic generated documents
	  point to their metadocs.  Also made some modules skip processing
	  dynamic documents.

	- [NEW] Added trailing whitespace pattern to banned module to check
	  for unnecessary white chars at the end of lines. Suggested by Andr√©s
	  Pereira (borges).

	- [NEW] Added list-mode option. Allow repodoc to summarize the status
	  of each doc based on the worst result found on one of its modules
	  checks. If the result is OK, it means all modules are happy with
	  your doc, so you get a cookie. Thanks to Francesc Gordillo
	  (frangor@gmail.com).

	- [NEW] External program to evaluate an arbitrary number of XPath
	  expressions on an arbitrary number of documents. Uses libxml2 to do
	  the real work.  It helps getting rid of huge, horrible and buggy
	  awk/sed chunks. (thanks to ferdy)

	- [NEW] Internal rewrite. Some common code has bin split into files
	  under the lib/ directory. This is a first step to write external
	  applications that share functionality with repodoc.

	- [MOD] Banned module now accepts users patterns defined via
	  ~/repodoc/config/patterns in an easy way using the rule:
	  <special|basic> <language|all> <banned-word|sed-pattern <id>>

	- [MOD] Trans module has been rewritten. Context information is added
	  to each node of the XML tree thus making diffs denser. It gets XML
	  trees from xmllint so it should be a pretty reliable module now.

	- [FIX] Links module fixed. Previous version skips some of the links
	  which need to be checked. Now is able to parse doc internal anchors
	  (#doc_*). Some handbook links will give a false positive, need a bit
	  more of work to fix this.

* 0.1_beta ( 2006-04-02 )

	- [NEW] Added support for colors and alignment on the output. Thanks to
	  vanquirius@gentoo.org and ferdy. FOSDEM hacking product(tm).

	  FOSDEM hacking product(tm).

	- [NEW] Added support to work with the whole cvs (including /proj/,
	  /main/, etc.). FOSDEM hacking product(tm).

	- [NEW] Added new module "Banned". It takes care of all dangerous
	  words one wants to have under control. FOSDEM hacking product(tm).

	- [NEW] Added new module "Links". It checks that doc links point to
	  existing files. FOSDEM hacking product (tm).
	
	- [NEW] Added new module "up2date". It takes care of check if date
	  and version tags are the same on the original and translation.

	- [NEW] Added new module "version". It takes care of check if
	  version tag is the same on the original and the translation.

	- [MOD] New keyword system for the modules. KEYWORDS now behaves like it
	  does in ebuilds. A big thanks to ferdy here.

	- [MOD] Improved return code in modules. Now support to return command
	  with the following codes:
		0  - ok
		1  - warning
		2  - critical

	- [MOD] Improved the code to check whether the file provided as
	  argument exists or not.

	- [MOD] Length module. Improved output by showing the number of the
	  offending lines.

	- [FIX] Length module. Now is able to parse an ignore whole <pre>
	  blocks.
