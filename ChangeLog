* 0.1_beta3 ( 2006-12-08 )

	- [NEW] Docman tool. The docman tool is just a wrapper, with no
	  special functionality.  It works using modules, which are inside
	  modules/docman. Modules have the really useful code. See each one
	  to know what they do.

	- [NEW] "sync" docman-module.  It can sync version and/or date
	  tags from an english original doc to a translation. It works just
	  copying and overwriting translation content tag with the original
	  doc one's.

	- [NEW] "bump" docman-module. Bumps version and date tags.
	  The module is able to bump date and/or version xml tags. Date
	  will be set to current date and version will be updated depends
	  on the doc numbering schema. Can hadle "x.x.x" ,"x.x" and just
	  "x" schemas.

	- [NEW] "get" docman-module. New docman GET module. Download xml
	  doc source from gentoo.org. The module download the doc xml code
	  direct from gentoo.org. It  uses ?passthru=1 option. Can be used
	  with a direct url or by  default, with a --lang attribute and
	  /doc/ domain.

	- [NEW] langlinks repodoc-module. It takes care of check if gentoo
	  links in translations point to an english doc and warn if a
	  translation for the linked doc is available.

	- [NEW] Support for use REPODOC_HOME (if set) instead of HOME to
	  save data. Dedicated to our Soc dev "Anant Narayanan" ;)

	- [NEW] docpath lib. implements operations related with extracting
	  info from the doc path.

	- [MOD] Lots of code cleaning and fixes, thanks to ferdy, as
	  usual.

	- [FIX] figure bug in links module. Thanks to rane@gentoo.org.

	- [FIX] Fix repodoc length.module. Skip checking <guide> and some
	  <uri> lines. Thanks to rane@gentoo.org for reporting and to
	  Jacobo G.Polavieja <jacobopolavieja@gmail.com> for fixing.

* 0.1_beta2 ( 2006-17-06 )

	- [NEW] Dyn-meta module. Checks whether dynamic generated documents
	  point to their metadocs.  Also made some modules skip processing
	  dynamic documents.

	- [NEW] Added trailing whitespace pattern to banned module to check
	  for unnecessary white chars at the end of lines. Suggested by Andr√©s
	  Pereira (borges).

	- [NEW] Added list-mode option. Allow repodoc to summarize the status
	  of each doc based on the worst result found on one of its modules
	  checks. If the result is OK, it means all modules are happy with
	  your doc, so you get a cookie. Thanks to Francesc Gordillo
	  (frangor@gmail.com).

	- [NEW] External program to evaluate an arbitrary number of XPath
	  expressions on an arbitrary number of documents. Uses libxml2 to do
	  the real work.  It helps getting rid of huge, horrible and buggy
	  awk/sed chunks. (thanks to ferdy)

	- [NEW] Internal rewrite. Some common code has bin split into files
	  under the lib/ directory. This is a first step to write external
	  applications that share functionality with repodoc.

	- [MOD] Banned module now accepts users patterns defined via
	  ~/repodoc/config/patterns in an easy way using the rule:
	  <special|basic> <language|all> <banned-word|sed-pattern <id>>

	- [MOD] Trans module has been rewritten. Context information is added
	  to each node of the XML tree thus making diffs denser. It gets XML
	  trees from xmllint so it should be a pretty reliable module now.

	- [FIX] Links module fixed. Previous version skips some of the links
	  which need to be checked. Now is able to parse doc internal anchors
	  (#doc_*). Some handbook links will give a false positive, need a bit
	  more of work to fix this.

	- [NEW] Added new module "Links". It checks that doc links point to

	- [NEW] Added new module "up2date". It takes care of check if date

	- [NEW] Added new module "version". It takes care of check if
	  version tag is the same on the original and the translation.

	- [MOD] New keyword system for the modules. KEYWORDS now behaves like it
	  does in ebuilds. A big thanks to ferdy here.

	- [MOD] Improved return code in modules. Now support to return command
	  with the following codes:

		1  - warning
		2  - critical

	- [MOD] Improved the code to check whether the file provided as
	  argument exists or not.
