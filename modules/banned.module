# Patterns.
# In this section we define the patterns we want to use with the module.
# You can define your own patterns following the syntax:
#
# banpattern_${pattern_name}='sed-pattern-to-use'
#

# Examples:

# 1. Basic pattern
# Find an specific word and marks it (in the log) with uppercase letters.
# You can just copy it and replace "links2" by the word you like to
# be warned about.
#
# This pattern finds links2 (which is deprecated in favor of justl links)
# and marks it with uppercase letters in user log if it was found.
# Please, remember to use the sed command '=' in order to get the line numbers
# appear in the log.
banpattern_links2='/\(links2\)/{=;s//\U\1\E/gp}'

# 2. Other patterns.
# If you know a little bit about sed, you can just define whatever action
# you like to apply to the pattern found.

# This pattern finds tabs and marks them with a '#' mark
banpattern_tabs='/\t/{=;s//####/gp}'

# Find trailing whitespaces
banpattern_trailingwhitespaces='/[[:blank:]]\+$/{=;s//####/p}'
